- Restyled search page to hero layout and modern form controls
- Restyled search results into responsive card grid with hover effects
- Restyled homestay details into two-column layout with sticky booking card
- Restyled booking, login, register forms with improved inputs and error states

PR Title:
feat(ui): migrate site templates from Bootstrap to Tailwind (CDN) â€” improve visuals

PR Description (concise)
- Migrated all main templates from Bootstrap to Tailwind via CDN and restyled UI for a modern, responsive look.
- Added [`src/main/resources/templates/fragments/head.html`](src/main/resources/templates/fragments/head.html:1) with Tailwind CDN, Inter font, and Alpine.js.
- Updated navbar with responsive mobile menu (Alpine).
- Restyled search, results, homestay details, booking, login, and register pages.
- Added [`RUNNING.md`](RUNNING.md:1) with local run instructions.

Review checklist
- [ ] Run app and verify pages render correctly on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Check form submit flows (login/register/book) for regressions
- [ ] Confirm no leftover Bootstrap references (none found)
- [ ] Accessibility quick pass: color contrast and focus outlines

Notes and follow-ups
- Consider migrating to a full Tailwind build (npm/PostCSS) later for smaller CSS and custom themes
- If you want color tweaks, tell me which primary/accent hex codes to apply

End.
